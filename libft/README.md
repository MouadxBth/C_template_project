# Libft

## Summary
   	This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll
	be use for all your next projects.

## Introduction
   C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project allows you to re-write those functions, understand them,
and learn to use them. This library will help you with all your future C projects.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. But always, make sure to
check which functions are allowed !

## Part 1 - Libc functions

*In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their
man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. Your functions’ names must be prefixed by **“ft_”**. For instance **strlen** becomes
**ft_strlen**.
You must re-code the following functions. These function do not need any external
functions:*

• isalpha	• isdigit

• isalnum	• isascii

• isprint	• strlen

• memset	• bzero

• memcpy	• memmove

• strlcpy	• strlcat

• toupper	• tolower

• strchr	• strrchr

• strncmp	• memchr

• memcmp	• strnstr

• atoi

*You must also re-code the following functions, using the function **“malloc”**:*

• calloc

• strdup
